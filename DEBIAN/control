Description: Scripts for monitoring IBM Integration Bus with Zabbix
 Monitoring is implemented with a python script that listens for MQTT messages,
 sent by IBM integration Bus.
 Received messages are written to disk (Default: /tmp/zabbix-iib-monitor.json),
 from where a Zabbix agent polls the required data to Zabbix.
